//the human assault class and its corpses

//Peter "Superfly" Johnson--
//The Assault Troop of Detachment 4F are hand-picked from the top ranks of the
//Crimson Guard. Great all-round performers, they are armed with a light machine
//gun which is capable of delivering great suppressive firepower. For this
//assignment they have also been issued a grenade launcher, as its
//indiscriminate nature makes it easier to target that what cannot be seen,
//and its indirect fire capability lets it reach into those nooks and crannies
//where other firearms are less likely to hit.
//Peter "Superfly" Johnson comes from a humble Chicago background
//doing odd jobs in their late teens and early twenties until they finally
//struck gold with a hardcore pornography gig (called "Superfly's Johnson")
//that gave them the funds they needed to move their family out of West Englewood.
//Shortly after this stint in the pornography industry, Peter "Superfly" Johnson
//used their physical talents and high testosterone for a more noble purpose; killing space bugs.
//Peter was recognized by the Crimson Guard for their ruthlessness and efficiency in combat
//and was recommended for a promotion to a more specialized job that required certain discretions: Human Resources.

//"Come on in, you fuckers. Come on in. Ol' Painless is waitin'."
